SetIDRange
~~~~~~~~~~

<b>Prototype:</b> function SetIDRange ( $min, $max )

Sets an accepted range of document IDs. Parameters must be integers.
Defaults are 0 and 0; that combination means to not limit by range.

After this call, only those records that have document ID between
``$min`` and ``$max`` (including IDs exactly equal to ``$min`` or
``$max``) will be matched.
