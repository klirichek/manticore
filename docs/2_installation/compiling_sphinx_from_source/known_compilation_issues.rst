Known compilation issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If ``configure`` fails to locate MySQL headers and/or libraries, try
checking for and installing ``mysql-devel`` package. On some systems, it
is not installed by default.

If ``make`` fails with a message which look like

::


    /bin/sh: g++: command not found
    make[1]: *** [libsphinx_a-sphinx.o] Error 127

try checking for and installing ``gcc-c++`` package.

If you are getting compile-time errors which look like

::


    sphinx.cpp:67: error: invalid application of `sizeof' to
        incomplete type `Private::SizeError<false>'

this means that some compile-time type size check failed. The most
probable reason is that off\_t type is less than 64-bit on your system.
As a quick hack, you can edit sphinx.h and replace off\_t with DWORD in
a typedef for SphOffset\_t, but note that this will prohibit you from
using full-text indexes larger than 2 GB. Even if the hack helps, please
report such issues, providing the exact error message and compiler/OS
details, so I could properly fix them in next releases.

If you keep getting any other error, or the suggestions above do not
seem to help you, please don't hesitate to contact me.
