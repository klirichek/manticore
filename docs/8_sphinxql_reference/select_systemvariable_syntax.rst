SELECT @@system\_variable syntax
--------------------------------

::


    SELECT @@system_variable [LIMIT [offset,] row_count]

Added in version 2.0.2-beta, this is currently a placeholder query that
does nothing and reports success. That is in order to keep compatibility
with frameworks and connectors that automatically execute this
statement.
