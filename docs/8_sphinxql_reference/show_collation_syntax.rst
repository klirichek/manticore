SHOW COLLATION syntax
---------------------

::


    SHOW COLLATION

Added in version 2.0.1-beta, this is currently a placeholder query that
does nothing and reports success. That is in order to keep compatibility
with frameworks and connectors that automatically execute this
statement.

::


    mysql> SHOW COLLATION;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
